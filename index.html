## DinoTank

Dinosaurs driving tanks, naturally! I implemented the fundamental features and framework for this Android mobile game and took a lead role in it's development and future release. DinoTank features dynamic combat, single player campaign, multiplayer combat, advanced physics, monetization/upgrade system and currency. Apart from the core of the game, I also implemented advanced features such as realistic tank physics, projectile ballistics computations, damage modeling, advanced AI, object pooling, latency compensation, state storage system, mesh welding, all UI + scenes and transisions, post processing and shaders, and other systems. 
The target demographic (8-14) love it.
